# predicting_clothing_size_with_regression
Author: Ng Wei Xuan

Project Description:

This project predicts the clothing size of a customer using the renttherunway dataset to solve the problem of customers purchasing clothes online, only to find that the size does not fit them when they receive it.

Linear Regression and KNN Regression models will be used in this project to predict the dress size of customers in order to alleviate the problem of online purchases being not fitting. By alleviating this issue, the business will not only receive better reviews on their site but it will also save on costs associated with returns. The customers will also save on time and effort to raise return requests and following up on such requests.

The process consists of 3 components: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis and Application of the Linear and KNN Regression models.

Python and Jupyter Notebook are required to run the file.

How to use:

1. Please download the dataset 'renttherunway_final_data.json' from https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation#renttherunway_final_data.json

2. Please download the project files (Clone or download button in green >> Click Download ZIP) and unzip them.

3. Install the required packages. Packages required: pandas, numpy, sklearn, statsmodels, matplotlib

4. After downloading the datasets, place them in the same directory as 'Predicting Clothing Size With Regression.ipynb' and open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

5. Alternatively, you can view the code by viewing the html document (Predicting Clothing Size With Regression.html).
